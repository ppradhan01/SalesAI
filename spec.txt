We'll go through the end-to-end process of developing an Enterprise project.

Application Architecture: 
frontend is react and backend is python fastapi. 
frontend shows a catalog of AI agents.
The catalog should be organized by 'sales stage' - targeting, origination, progression, and growth.
these agents are essentially json files representing n8n workflows as code.
A chat interface on the frontend allows calling webhooks that can trigger agents in n8n, and relay output back to the chat.
A user session should have persistent state. 


Deployment architecture: 
The system is to be deployed on AWS on a secure VPC. Provide step-by-step instructions to set this up in AWS. A public URL should be exposed for users to access the application over the internet. 

CI/CD:
The local development environment is VSCode. Provide step by step instructions to setup the project and associated dependencies.
The system should have a git repo. 
Provide step by step instructions to setup the repo.
After local testing, when changes are committed to the repo, it should be deployed on AWS.

Break this down step-by-step, with incremental testing / validation of each step along the way.
